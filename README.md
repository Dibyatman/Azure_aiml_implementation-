Azure Text Analytics API: Requires an Azure API endpoint and key.
Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Azur-aiml-implementation.git

bash
Copy code
pip install python-dotenv
Configure environment variables:

Create a .env file with:
env
Copy code
AI_SERVICE_ENDPOINT=your_azure_endpoint
AI_SERVICE_KEY=your_azure_key
Usage
Run the script:
bash
Copy code
python script_name.py
Enter text to detect its language; type "quit" to exit.
Sample Output
Entering "Bonjour" as input might produce:

json
Copy code
{
  "documents": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "detectedLanguage": {
        "name": "French",
        "iso6391Name": "fr",
        "confidenceScore": 1.0
      }
    }
  ]
}

Language: French
Error Handling
Common errors include:

Authentication Error: Invalid API key.
Endpoint Error: Incorrect endpoint.





02.Language Detection with Azure Text Analytics Client
This repository contains the first project in learning AI/ML with Azure using the Azure Text Analytics Client SDK to detect the language of user-input text.

Overview
This Python script takes text input from the user, sends it to Azure’s Text Analytics service using the TextAnalyticsClient, and returns the detected language. It’s an introductory project to explore cloud-based AI/ML capabilities.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries: dotenv, azure-ai-textanalytics
Azure Text Analytics API: Requires an endpoint URL and API key.
Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Azur-aiml-implementation.git
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install python-dotenv azure-ai-textanalytics
Configure environment variables:

Create a .env file in the project directory and add:
env
Copy code
AI_SERVICE_ENDPOINT=your_azure_endpoint
AI_SERVICE_KEY=your_azure_key
Usage
Run the script:
bash
Copy code
python script_name.py
Enter text to detect its language; type "quit" to exit.
Sample Output
Entering "Hola" as input might produce:

makefile
Copy code
Language: Spanish
Error Handling
Common errors include:

Authentication Error: Invalid API key.
Endpoint Error: Incorrect endpoint.





03. Background Removal and Image Analysis with Azure Computer Vision
This repository contains the second project in learning AI/ML with Azure, focused on background removal and image analysis using the Azure Computer Vision service.

Overview
This Python script connects to Azure's Computer Vision API to:

Analyze an image for specified features.
Remove the background or create a foreground matte from the image.
It's part of an ongoing exploration into Azure AI/ML capabilities, leveraging cloud-based vision services.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries: dotenv, Pillow (PIL), matplotlib, requests, azure.core.exceptions
Azure Computer Vision API: Requires an endpoint URL and API key.
Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Dibyatman/Azure_aiml_implementation-
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install python-dotenv Pillow matplotlib requests azure-core
Configure environment variables:

Create a .env file in the project directory with:
env
Copy code
AI_SERVICE_ENDPOINT=your_azure_endpoint
AI_SERVICE_KEY=your_azure_key
Add an image file:

Place an image in an images folder and name it street.jpg, or provide the file path as a command-line argument when running the script.
Usage
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python script_name.py
Alternatively, specify a different image file:
bash
Copy code
python script_name.py images/your_image.jpg
The script will analyze the image and perform background removal or foreground extraction as specified.

Sample Output
The output will display the analyzed image features and save or display the image with the background removed.

Error Handling
Common errors include:

Authentication Error: Invalid API key.
HTTP Response Error: Issues with image format or endpoint configurations.



04. Azure AI Vision Text Reader
This project leverages the Azure AI Vision SDK to read text from images, with options for both printed and handwritten text. This example demonstrates setting up an Azure Vision client to analyze images, extract text, and highlight the detected text on the image.

Features
Text Extraction: Uses the Azure AI Vision SDK to detect and read text from images.
Bounding Polygon Visualization: Highlights text and bounding polygons for each detected word or line in the image.
User Options: Menu-driven interface for selecting different images to analyze.
Overview
The project uses Azure AI Vision Text Reader to:

Detect and read text within images.
Process and extract text in Indian languages.
This tool showcases Azure's AI/ML capabilities for optical character recognition, allowing for cloud-based processing.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries: dotenv, requests, azure.core.exceptions
Azure AI Vision Text Reader API: Requires an endpoint URL and API key.
Setup
Clone the repository (Repository developed in-house):

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/YourGitHub/Azure_Text_Reader_Project
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install python-dotenv requests azure-core
Configure environment variables:

Create a .env file in the project directory with:

env
Copy code
AI_SERVICE_ENDPOINT=your_azure_endpoint
AI_SERVICE_KEY=your_azure_key
Add an image file:

Place an image in the images folder with the desired text for processing, or provide the file path as a command-line argument.
